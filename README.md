## What is Quotex?

Quotex is a binary options trading platform that allows traders to
speculate on the price of assets such as stocks, currencies,
commodities, and indices. Binary options are a type of financial
instrument that pays out a fixed return if the price of the underlying

## Is Quotex Halal?

The question of whether Quotex is halal or haram is a complex one. There
is no easy answer, as it depends on a number of factors, including the
individual trader\'s interpretation of Islamic law.

However, there are a number of arguments that can be made in favor of
the view that Quotex is halal. First, binary options are not considered
to be gambling under Islamic law. This is because gambling involves
betting on an uncertain event, while binary options involve speculating
on the price of an asset.

Second, Quotex does not charge any interest on its trading accounts.
This is important because interest is considered to be usury under
Islamic law.

Finally, Quotex is a regulated platform that is subject to the laws of
the United Kingdom. This provides traders with a level of protection and
ensures that the platform is operated in a fair and transparent manner.
